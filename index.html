        <h2>Why did I join CodeNation</h2>
        <p>As i said previously, coding is my passion. I have always dreamt about becoming a developer. Too bad my mom thought I wasn't good enough for it.<br>
           I wasn't good at maths , never been. So my parents decided for me what school to pick, eventually I became a chef.<br>
           Now I had the opportunity to join CodeNation and their 3 months program to help me achieve the skills I will need to start my new career!!!</p>

    <div id="weekTarg">
        <h2>Week one targets and achievements</h2>
        <p>We started with JavaScript and I had hard times the first few days, but I wrapped my head around it and started doing the exercises by myself. 
            Lesson after lesson I would understand more and improve my writing and now I can understand the basics of JS.<br>
             Next target for me is implementing what I've learned from the past week into my HTML and CSS vocabulary so that I can create more complex projects. </p>
